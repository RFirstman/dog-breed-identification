# dog-breed-identification

Final project for CS 7643: Deep Learning at Georgia Tech.

In this project, we aimed to build a deep neural network to classify images of dogs into their respective breeds.
For this project, we utilized the [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).
We experimented with a from-scratch model and transfer learning to yield an 84% testing accuracy.
